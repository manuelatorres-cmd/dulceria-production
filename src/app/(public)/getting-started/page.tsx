          I built Dulceria because my own recipes lived everywhere — spreadsheets, notebooks, PDFs, a Google doc,
          the occasional cocoa butter splattered paper. Rescaling a ganache for a different mould was a guessing
          game. I never really knew what each bonbon cost me to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dulceria is an app that sits on your iPad, phone, or laptop
          and keeps your entire workshop in one place: ingredients, fillings, products, production
          plans, stock, variants, and a little bit of business intelligence. Your data lives in your
          browser — no account, no server, no lock-in. If you want to sync across devices later, you
          can bring your own Dexie Cloud database. Otherwise it works fully offline, for free and always will.
        </p>
        <Callout kind="tip" title="Five-minute promise">
          If you follow the quickstart below, you&apos;ll have a product, a filling, an ingredient, and
          a mock production plan in about five minutes. Then you can decide whether the app is worth
          the rest of the afternoon.

    render: () => (
      <>
        <p className="sub">
          Dulceria can be used in two ways. Both give you the same features;
          the difference is who runs the server — and whether your data can sync
          across devices.
        </p>
        <h3>Local (the default)</h3>
        <p>
          If someone gave you a folder, you cloned the repo, or you&apos;re running
          the app from a packaged download, you&apos;re on a local install. The app
          lives entirely in your browser: no account, no login, no server to talk
          to. Your data is stored in your browser&apos;s local database and never
          leaves the device.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What&apos;s good:</strong> no account; no monthly fees; works
            offline forever; your data is physically on your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What to watch out for:</strong> data is tied to this one
            browser on this one device. Clear your browser data and it&apos;s
            gone. No sync across iPad + laptop. <strong>Backup is essential</strong>
            {" "}— see section 14.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hosted (with Dexie Cloud sync)</h3>
        <p>
          If you opened the app at a public URL (e.g. a{" "}
          <code>dulceria</code> domain someone else is running) and were asked
          for an email to sign in, you&apos;re on a hosted version. Data still
          lives primarily in your browser, but it&apos;s also synced to a personal
          Dexie Cloud database so it&apos;s available on every device you sign in
          from.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What&apos;s good:</strong> works across iPad + laptop
            automatically; survives a browser reset; the one-time-code email
            login means no password to lose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What to watch out for:</strong> your data is also stored by
            Dexie (the sync provider); their free tier is generous but has limits;
            read their{" "}
            <a href="https://dexie.org/cloud/docs/terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              terms
            </a>{" "}
            before you store anything you wouldn&apos;t want a third party to
            hold. You can export a local backup at any time.
          </li>

          bar, or use the browser menu&apos;s <strong>Install Dulceria</strong>. Safari on macOS

            Most often this is a browser that aggressively clears &ldquo;website data&rdquo; — Safari
            in Private mode, some privacy extensions, or clearing cache. Install the app as a PWA
            (section 03) and keep it installed; that makes your data much stickier. Also: export a
            backup weekly.

          <summary>Can anyone see my recipes or business data — including you?</summary>
          <p>
            <strong>No — and in the default setup, it&apos;s not a question of trust, it&apos;s
            architectural.</strong> Dulceria has no server I run. There is no admin panel,
            no &ldquo;all users&rdquo; dashboard on my end, no database on my laptop with your
            recipes in it. I literally cannot see your data because there&apos;s nowhere for me
            to see it from.
          </p>
          <p>What that means in each of the two ways to run the app:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Local install.</strong> Your data lives in your browser&apos;s local
              database, on your device only. Nothing is sent anywhere. Turn off the internet and
              the app still works identically.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-hosted with Dexie Cloud sync.</strong> Your data syncs to <em>your own</em>{" "}
              Dexie Cloud database — registered to your email, on your Dexie account, under your

              the synced data on their servers; read their{" "}

            You can verify all of this yourself: the app is open source at{" "}

        <details>
          <summary>Is this built for a team, or just for one chocolatier?</summary>
          <p>
            <strong>Just for one.</strong> Dulceria is designed top-to-bottom for a single
            chocolatier running their own workshop. There&apos;s no concept of a shared workshop,
            shared pantry, or team workspace inside the app — by design.
          </p>
          <p>What that means in practice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Same person, multiple devices — works great.</strong> Sign in with the same
              email on your iPad, laptop, and phone; Dexie Cloud keeps them in sync. This is the
              intended setup for anyone who wants more than local-only.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multiple people sharing one workshop — not supported.</strong> If you invite
              a second user through Dexie Cloud&apos;s user management, they can sign in to your
              hosted instance, but they&apos;ll land in their own isolated workshop. Your
              ingredients, fillings, and products don&apos;t appear for them, and vice versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Roles and permissions — none.</strong> There&apos;s no &ldquo;admin vs
              baker&rdquo; distinction, no read-only view for a business partner, no audit log of
              who changed what.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is intentional. Most artisan chocolate businesses are one or two people; a full
            team-collab product would be overkill, and the single-user model is what keeps the
            architecture simple, hosting friendly to Dexie&apos;s free tier, and the privacy story
            clean — no shared database means nothing to get into each other&apos;s.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you genuinely need a second person viewing or editing the same data, the
            practical workaround today is sharing a single login across devices. If your business
            grows to the point where that doesn&apos;t cut it, tell me. Multi-user support
            isn&apos;t on the roadmap, but demand could change that.

          <p>
            Shell-chocolate dropdowns only list ingredients you&apos;ve explicitly marked as{" "}
            <em>shell capable</em>. This is so your picker isn&apos;t cluttered with every
            chocolate in your pantry — only the couverture ones that are actually viable for
            tempering a shell.
          </p>
          <p>To fix it:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Open the ingredient you want to use (Ingredients → pick the chocolate). Its
              category must be <strong>Chocolate</strong> — the shell-capable checkbox only
              appears for that category.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tick <strong>&ldquo;Can be used as shell chocolate (couverture)&rdquo;</strong> and save.
            </li>
            <li>
              Back on the product recipe, it&apos;ll now show up in the shell dropdown.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If the checkbox doesn&apos;t appear, double-check the ingredient&apos;s category is{" "}
            <strong>Chocolate</strong> (not &ldquo;Couverture&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cocoa butter&rdquo;,
            or similar — those are separate categories).

            {" "}on Instagram. Dulceria started as my own tool — the thing I kept wishing existed at an affordable price
            while juggling spreadsheets, a notebook, and a recipe Google doc in the middle of a
            tempering session. Once it was usable, it felt wrong to keep it to myself, so here it
            is. If you want to see what I&apos;m making with it, the Instagram is the best window.

            some of it back. I learned a lot of what I know about tempering, ganache ratios, shell
            thickness, shelf life — not from a course, but from chocolatiers who shared openly.

              <strong>Ingredient composition data.</strong> One of the things I want to crowd-source
              is a shared library of ingredients with their fat / sugar / water / cocoa solids
              composition, so new users don&apos;t have to type in every chocolate from scratch. In
              future, you&apos;ll be able to pick which library to seed from when you set up the
              app. If you have a well-curated ingredient list, that&apos;s gold.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mould and decoration seed data.</strong> A shared database of common moulds
              (dimensions, cavity counts, shell-weight references) and decoration techniques/designs
              would save everyone a lot of manual entry. Same idea — you load from a community set
              rather than starting blank.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Setup and onboarding help.</strong> If you got through the install / Dexie
              Cloud setup and something tripped you up, tell me. The friction you remember is the
              friction the next person is about to hit.
            </li>
